<p>Thanks to all who came along (Andrea and Veronika &amp; our mentor, Mick) after a tiring working week and on a Friday evening just to learn about the command line interface. :-)</p>
<p>It was back to the Liffey Room (we used in Processing), and Jury&#8217;s Inn facilities were grand. After a wee wait for people to get their drinks and dinner ordered, we went ahead with the workshop.</p>

<p>I think this was off-topic a little bit, about being careful with exploits to databases.</p>

<p>This is somewhat related to the workshop, we were discussing about sudo.</p>
