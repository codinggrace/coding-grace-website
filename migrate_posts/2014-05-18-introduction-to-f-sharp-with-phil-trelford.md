# ABOUT CODING GRACE
[codinggrace.com](http://codinggrace.com) | [@codinggrace](https://twitter.com/codinggrace)

Coding Grace are a group of developers based in Ireland who love to code and do other geeky and not necessarily crafty activities. Some of us code full-time, or just for fun (or both). We have people who are part of other technical user groups such as Dublin ALT.NET, GameCraft, Python Ireland, Ruby Ireland and moreâ€¦

We provide female-friendly workshops and events in an environment for developers and aspiring developers mentored by majority female instructors. We aim to provide a support network for people from all backgrounds and hope our outreach will help bring those who are interested in code development together and learn from one another.
