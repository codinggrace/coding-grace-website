<p>Thanks to Lynn for sharing her inspiration from our #RaspberryPi workshop. It&#8217;s aÂ raspberry pi hooked up to my Maplins robotic arm - trying to teach it to prepare the tea&#8221;.</p>
<p>Anyone else have a Pi project to share? Leave your comments below. :-)</p>
<p>A vid I took of Mick testing out his LEGO motor after hooking up with the Pi with a curious kitten in tow. (NOTE: No kittens, owners or even the LEGO robot got harmed)</p>
