<p>Coding Grace is delighted to announce our latest upcoming workshop which will be hosted at Adverts.ie (thanks, <a href="https://twitter.com/tangentfairy">Ursula</a>).</p>
<p>Github has kindly offered a virtual training session on the basics of using Git. Coding Grace will also have a few volunteer mentors helping out and answering any questions arising from the workshop that evening.</p>
<p>Join Matthew McCullough from the GitHub Training team for an evening of learning the ins and outs of the Git version control system.</p>
<p>This revolutionary distributed version control system (DVCS) that has housed the Linux Kernel source for the last 8 years is the leading version control system of modern open source projects and becoming ever more popular in businesses too.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this class, you&#8217;ll be able to confidently start, manipulate, and leverage Git for storage of your code and collaboration on changes with colleagues around the world.</p>
